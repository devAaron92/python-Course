#Please write a program which asks the user to type in a string and a single character. 
#The program then prints the first three character slice which begins with the character specified by the user. 
#You may assume the input string is at least three characters long. The program must print out three characters, or else nothing.

#Pay special attention to when there are less than two characters left in the string after the first occurrence of the character looked for. 
#In that case nothing should be printed out, and there should not be any indexing errors when executing the program.
